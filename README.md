**Description:**
The Python Calculator project is a simple graphical calculator application built using the tkinter library in Python. This calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo, as well as evaluate complex mathematical expressions. Users can interact with the calculator by clicking on buttons to input numbers and operators, and then obtain the result by clicking the '=' button. The 'C' button clears the input field.

The calculator's user interface is clean and intuitive, featuring large buttons with responsive click functionality. The application provides both a visual and functional solution for performing calculations, making it a handy tool for quick mathematical tasks.

Key Features:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo).
- Ability to evaluate complex mathematical expressions.
- Clear button ('C') to reset the input field.
- User-friendly graphical interface with responsive buttons.
- Error handling for invalid expressions.

This Python Calculator project is a great way to practice GUI development with tkinter and to gain experience in handling user input for arithmetic operations.
